    "**\"Kick the ball harder, if you want to kick it further.\"** This is what I learned from a lot of people saying. \n",
    "\n",

    "Kickoff play is the most common type in special plays from season 2018 to 2020. Even though with six different outcomes, the kicking team has basically one ultimate goal - gaining as many yards as possible after the session ends. In this notebook, I'd bring up the **kick length** of the ball as an actionable and robust metric to evaluate how good a kickoff it is. This metric has a high positive association with the number of gained yards, since the receiving team needs to return the ball from a very low yard line if the ball is kicked long distance. Apart from that, with using the multiple linear regression method, I also find two relevant variables which might affect the kick length. Those are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Foot speed** in the approach, usually seen in a long approach distance, and it is also a predictor of the last step length, which is related with how much engergy will be transmitted to the ball, according to the formula of kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **direction of the ball being kicked to**. If the ball was kicked to the right side of the kicker, the length is usually shorter than to the center or to the left. The hypothesis behind is kicking to the right takes more energy from the body because of a larger pivoting angle. This cost of energy results in less volume brought to the ball.\n",

Considering the ultimate goal is to take the ball towards the end zone of the opponent side, one relevant metric could be how much yards the kickoff team gained after the play.

    "# Initial analysis - How to kick the ball far <a id=\"initial\"></a>\n",
    "The next question is how to kick a ball long distance, which should be a skill for kickers to handle. Before diving into what the data reveals to us, let's re-cap some physics at first. The whole process of kicking a ball is a transition of energy from the kicker's body to the ball. The energy exists due to the motion of an object is known as **Kinetic Energy**. Here is its formula ([4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy)) -\n",
    "> **KE = 1/2 * m$v^2$**\n",
    "\n",
    "inidicating that, given the mass of the kicker's body is unchanged, **the higher the velocity of the kicking leg, the more energy it will be generated and transmitted to the ball**, which contributes to a longer kick length. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the knowledge above, here we come up with two assumptions -\n",
    "* The part of the body contacting the ball is the kicker's foot, so ultimately, **is the speed of the kicking foot a useful predictor for kick length?** \n",
    "* **Does knowing the body orientation makes a difference in terms of the kicking length?** - Assuming since much more angle pivoted of the body will absorb more energy from transmitting to the ball\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By using multiple linear regression, we can see from the output that \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **kicker_s_50**, i.e. the median of the kicker's speed, which we use as a proxy of the foot speed in this case, is positively correlated with the kick length. It indicates that comparing two kicks that the ball was being kicked to the same direction, the one kicker has a faster speed by 1 yard per 0.1 second, its estimated kick length is **~7.1** units longer than the slower one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **direction of the ball being kicked to** is also postively associated with the kick length. The result implies that comparing three kicks with the same kicker's foot speed, if the ball was being kicked to the right, the kick length is estimated to be shorter by **~6.8** units, **~5.2** units than to the center or to the left, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model fit above has an R-squared value as 0.257, which indicates that **25.7%** of the variation of the kick length can be explained by the two independent variables, kicking foot speed and direction, together."

    "# Variable 1 - Foot speed <a id=\"speed\"></a>\n",
    "The positive relation between the kicking foot speed and the kick length has also been found in Australian Rules football([5](https://acephysed.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/atricle-1-reference-list.pdf)). Inspired by that paper, I was looking at whether there is a strong association between the foot speed and the last step length. I used the data **dis**, the distance traveled from prior time point, in yards (numeric), as a measure for estimating the length of the last step of each kick. And the outcome is promising. We can clearly see that the longer the last step length, the faster speed of the kick's foot. The foot speed has a very high positive correlation (**95.6%**) with the larger last step length before the kick, which usually indicates a larger angle of the pelvis. \n",
    "\n",
    "> So for the NFL professions and fans, if you see a kicker has a very large step before kicking the ball, it usually means he runs very fast towards the ball and the length of the kick shouldn't be short."
